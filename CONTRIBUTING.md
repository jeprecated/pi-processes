## Scope

`README.md` is for users.

Keep development details, testing notes, internal tool guidance, and docs build details in this file.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js `22.19.0` or newer
- pnpm `10.26.1`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Repository layout

- `src/` - Pi-agnostic process management, types, protocol, and utilities
- `extensions/processes/` - core extension, process tool (start, list, output, update, write, stop, clear), settings, lifecycle hooks, notifications, protocol handlers, `/ps`, `/ps:kill`, `/ps:clear`, and `/ps:settings`
- `extensions/processes-logs/` - `/ps:logs` command and log overlay
- `extensions/processes-dock/` - `/ps:dock`, `/ps:pin`, the dock widget, and the status widget
- `extensions/shared/` - shared UI helpers (`statusDot`, `processStatusTone`, `LineComponent`, etc.) used across all three extensions
- `skills/` - shipped package skills
- `.agents/skills/` - local repo-only skills for development workflows

## Package metadata

The package targets Pi `0.80.3`.

Pi bundles core packages for extensions. Keep direct imports of these packages in `peerDependencies` with `"*"` ranges and exact local versions in `devDependencies`:

- `@earendil-works/pi-ai`
- `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
- `@earendil-works/pi-tui`
- `typebox`

Keep normal third-party runtime dependencies in `dependencies`.

## Internal behavior

This extension is mainly for agent-managed background processes.

Typical flow:

1. Pi starts a long-running command in the background.
2. Pi continues other work.
3. The user watches, pins, or kills the process from the UI.
4. Pi inspects output or logs when needed.

Use the `process` tool for long-running commands such as dev servers, test watchers, build watchers, and log tails.

Avoid shell background patterns when the process tool fits.

Background command blocking is optional. It is controlled by `interception.blockBackgroundCommands`.

## Testing

Useful local checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
```

Useful manual process scripts live under `tests/e2e/scripts/`:

```bash
./tests/e2e/scripts/continuous-output.sh   # long-running stdout
./tests/e2e/scripts/error-log.sh            # interleaved info/error on stdout+stderr
./tests/e2e/scripts/exited-task.sh          # finite, exits 0
./tests/e2e/scripts/crash-on-file.sh <name>  # waits for a marker file then crashes
```

See `.agents/skills/pi-processes-testing/SKILL.md` for the full manual QA workflow and the complete fixture script reference.

## Docs conventions

### README

Keep `README.md` focused on user outcomes:

- what the extension does
- how users interact with it
- slash commands and UI behavior
- troubleshooting

Avoid putting these in `README.md`:

- dev commands
- test commands
- internal architecture details
- detailed tool-call schemas
- release workflow notes

### Docs page build

The docs page is generated from `README.md` by an external build, not in this repo. Keep `README.md` self-contained with only standard markdown.

## Future design notes

Unimplemented design notes live in `docs/`:

- `docs/future-cleanup-hooks.md` - planned `cleanup` support for `process start` / `process stop`

These describe intended future behavior, not current behavior. Active implementation work goes under `.agents/plans/`.
